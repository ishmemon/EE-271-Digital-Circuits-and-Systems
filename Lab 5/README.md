In this lab, we used an FSM to display various patterns on the DE1_SoC board. The patterns were meant to be wind patterns for pilots so they could
know when and how to land planes. The user can change the pattern via the switches just like an air traffic controller at an airport can change
the signal to send. Then, the pattern can be seen by the pilot so they can make informed decisions.
