In this lab, we modified our work in Lab 3 and created a new inventory classification systems using UPC codes. LEDR[2] told us whether the item
was discounted, and LEDR[5] told us whether it was stolen. The UPC codes display an image of the item on the HEX displays, with the items sofa, trash can,
ball, Nintendo switch, Air Pods, and playing cards being the items represented by UPC codes 000, 001, 011, 100, 101, 110 in that order.
