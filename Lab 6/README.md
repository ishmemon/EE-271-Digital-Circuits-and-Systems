In this lab we created a tug of war game using an FPGA board. Two players could play and use Keys 3 and 0 to move the light towards their end. Once the light is "pulled" 
all the way to the end, the player who wins (ONE or TWO) is displayed on the HEX displays. Switch 9 allows us to reset the game and start the light again at the center.
